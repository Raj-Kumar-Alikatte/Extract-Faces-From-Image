# Extract-Faces-From-Image

This 2022 Extract Faces From Image OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, This Python OpenCV Project With Source Code, Images make up a large amount of the data that gets generated each day, which makes the ability to process these images important. One method of processing images is via face detection. Face detection is a branch of image processing that uses machine learning to detect faces in images.

A OpenCV Extract Faces Python you will use a pre-trained Haar Cascade model from OpenCV and Python to detect and extract faces from an image. OpenCV is an open-source programming library that is used to process images.

A Haar Cascade is an object detection method used to locate an object of interest in images. The algorithm is trained on a large number of positive and negative samples, where positive samples are images that contain the object of interest. Negative samples are images that may contain anything but the desired object. Once trained, the classifier can then locate the object of interest in any new images.

# What is OpenCV? 

OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks.

In this Python OpenCV Project also includes a downloadable Python Project With Source Code for free, just find the downloadable source code below and click to start downloading.

By the way if you are new to python programming and you donâ€™t know what would be the the Python IDE to use, I have here a list of Best Python IDE for Windows, Linux, Mac OS that will suit for you. I also have here How to Download and Install Latest Version of Python on Windows.
